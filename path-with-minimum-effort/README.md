# Path With Minimum Effort

***

You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given `heights`, a 2D array of size `rows x columns`, where `heights[row][col]` represents the height of cell `(row, col)`. You are situated in the top-left cell, `(0, 0)`, and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, `(rows-1, columns-1)` (i.e., **0-indexed**). You can move **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum **effort**.

A route's **effort** is the **maximum absolute difference** in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return _the minimum **effort** required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell._

**Example 1:**

<pre><code>Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
<strong>Output:
</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:
</strong> The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/ex2.png)

<pre><code>Input: heights = [[1,2,3],[3,8,4],[5,3,5]]
<strong>Output:
</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:
</strong> The route of [1,2,3,4,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route [1,3,5,3,5].</code></pre>

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/ex3.png)

<pre><code>Input: heights = [[1,2,1,1,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,1,1,2,1]]
<strong>Output:
</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:
</strong> This route does not require any effort.</code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `rows == heights.length`
* `columns == heights[i].length`
* `1 <= rows, columns <= 100`
* `1 <= heights[i][j] <= 106`

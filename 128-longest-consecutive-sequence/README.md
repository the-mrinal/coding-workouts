# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Medium

***

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code>Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
<strong>Output:
</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:
</strong> The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code>Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
<strong>Output:
</strong> 9</code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

# 1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences

## Easy

***

You are given a string `s` consisting **only** of letters `'a'` and `'b'`. In a single step you can remove one **palindromic subsequence** from `s`.

Return _the **minimum** number of steps to make the given string empty_.

A string is a **subsequence** of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does **not** necessarily need to be contiguous.

A string is called **palindrome** if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code>Input: s = "ababa"
<strong>Output:
</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:
</strong> s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step.</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code>Input: s = "abb"
<strong>Output:
</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:
</strong> "abb" -> "bb" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".</code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code>Input: s = "baabb"
<strong>Output:
</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:
</strong> "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".</code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s[i]` is either `'a'` or `'b'`.

# 274. H-Index

## Medium

***

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return compute the researcher's `h`**-index**.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`**-index**.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code>Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
<strong>Output:
</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:
</strong> [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code>Input: citations = [1,3,1]
<strong>Output:
</strong> 1</code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `n == citations.length`
* `1 <= n <= 5000`
* `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

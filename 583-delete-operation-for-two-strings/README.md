# 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings

## Medium

***

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return _the minimum number of **steps** required to make_ `word1` _and_ `word2` _the same_.

In one **step**, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code>Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
<strong>Output:
</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:
</strong> You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code>Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"
<strong>Output:
</strong> 4</code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
* `word1` and `word2` consist of only lowercase English letters.

# 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence

## Medium

***

Given a string `s`, find _the longest palindromic **subsequence**'s length in_ `s`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code>Input: s = "bbbab"
<strong>Output:
</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:
</strong> One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code>Input: s = "cbbd"
<strong>Output:
</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:
</strong> One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".</code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
